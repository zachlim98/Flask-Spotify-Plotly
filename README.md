# Spotify-Flask-Plotly Baseline Template

This repo serves as a baseline template for anyone wishing to develop a Flask App that uses the [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/) library and needs to use OAuth2 to authenticate. I struggled quite a bit doing that and so I'm sharing this template in the hopes that it'll be easier for anyone to do this. 

I've also taken reference from [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/web-visualization-with-plotly-and-flask-3660abf9c946?gi=26b80bee705c) which shows how to very easily include Plotly charts within Flask (without incurring all the trouble of having to integrate Dash and Flask). 

Please do credit if you use this baseline. Thank you and all the best!
